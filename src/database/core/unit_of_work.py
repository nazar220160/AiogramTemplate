    Represents a unit of work (UoW) for managing transactions and database operations using SQLAlchemy with asynchronous support.

    This class implements the AbstractUnitOfWork interface and provides methods for committing and rolling back transactions,
    as well as creating and closing transactions using an SQLAlchemy AsyncSession.

    Args:
        session (AsyncSession): The SQLAlchemy asynchronous session to be used for database operations within the unit of work.

    Attributes:
        _session (AsyncSession): The asynchronous session associated with the unit of work.
        _transaction (AsyncSessionTransaction): The current transaction within the unit of work.

    Raises:
        CommitError: If an error occurs while attempting to commit the transaction.
        RollbackError: If an error occurs while attempting to rollback the transaction.
